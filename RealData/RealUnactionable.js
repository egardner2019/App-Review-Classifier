  "I've really been enjoying the game. It doesn't require so much constant attention like some other online games and it feels like the events occur often enough to keep me engaged when I hit a wall in improving. I love seeing all my favorite characters and reliving moments from the comic. The costumes are cute too! Though I don't pay any money into the game and there are definitely whales, I still find I can enjoy the game.",
  "I love having animations and voices to the story. That's very well done (though some voices aren't what I expected). But the gameplay is meh, in that there really isn't any. It's a standard auto battler. While they've made some great improvements, like upgrading slots instead of characters, duplicates are still a ton of the power in the game, so you'll rely mostly on who you draw a bunch of. This is made worse because of having to play around elements. Rates are at least decent though.",
  "Fun game without any pay walls (technically) however, there are many opportunities to spend money to gain advantages over f2p players. You can have a great time without ever spending money, however, those who do choose to spend will progress significantly faster than those who don't. Some games only let you do a few races before having to wait to play another. This game will let you play nonstop. There is a fuel system that takes time to restore, but its on a per car basis, so just switch cars.",
  "Gameplay in Asphalt 9 centers around high-speed racing action with an arcade-style approach. The controls are designed to be intuitive, making it easy for both casual and hardcore gamers to enjoy. The game offers a variety of control options, including touch and tilt controls, catering to different player preferences. The TouchDrive feature allows players to focus on steering while the game handles acceleration, braking, and nitro boosts, simplifying the experience.",
  "I've been playing this game for years now. It's my favorite game EVER. There is always some side story line going on and the challenges and Regattas are super fun and keep things interesting. Also, you do spend money on this game (you don't have too) If you don't it just takes longer to do things. I spent a lot of money on this game, which I don't mind. The video showing this game isn't how it actually is which most game manufacturers show some random video clip lmao. Anyways, BEST GAME EVER.",
  "Really fun game, have been playing it for a while now. I find it very hard to find games that I don't lose interest in. This one has lots of different things to do to stay interested. Heaps of ways to earn points/lives/coins etc. Love it!",
  "Very addicting, some games like this reach a threshold where you can only play a tiny amount per several hours or spend cash, but this one I've still been able to spend as much time as I want filling orders and upgrading my town. It's refreshing. And there's new ways to play almost every day. Definitely worth a try if you like farming/base building style games!",
  "I'm really liking this game. It's a great reminder that you need certain items in order to do things. For instance, you need to plant seeds & harvest wheat so that workers can make bread. I love keeping up with what I need in order to fill orders. I really love the chickens & how they prompt me to collect their eggs. The sheep are so cute too! I need to keep them fed so they don't shiver.",
  "It's so enjoyable. I really like that I can leave it for couples of days or weeks without anything happened to my plants and animals. I also like that developer shorten the waiting time for each event games. Thank you and more power!",
  "Love this game! No need to spend money if you don't want too and don't have to have friends to keep giving you lives for the main game. You can play this non stop pretty much and will keep making things and growing crops while you sleep. Races against friends and can set up your own Co-Op with 30 members after stage 19.",
  "This is my favorite game. I have been playing daily for over a year. So much to do. Team regattas, Trains, planes, boats, helicopters, and zoo orders to fill. Farming and manufacturing, mining, decorating. Adventures that take energy refilled by time and winning challenging matching games. Always growing your town by building and populating it. The graphics are cute and dynamic. You even get to name animals in the zoo. There are reward chests and game money to be won. NO ADS!",
  "I just love this game. Started playing it 4 years ago. Then I do not know why I took a gap of 2 years. But, when I came again, I again got addicted to it. This game is casual, easy to play, the colour scheme (Red & Green) is good. The way you level up is statisfying. This game is a good time-passer. You could play it for hours and not get bored. How you mainly level up and the main thing to do is complete helicopter orders and filling trains and aeroplane crates. This game is a must",
  "I found this game through a pay-for-play app. It quickly grew on me because of its conciseness and creativity, the whimsical designs, and ts general set-up. There is a nice time spacing built into the game, so that one does not fall into a 24h play frenzy. it is just the right game to kick back and dream. thank you!",
  "I just enjoy this game! Last year I had surgery but they didn't do the nerve blocker well so I could feel the pain the minute I woke up BUT when I couldn't sleep cause it hurt, I played this game to distract me. Got very far in it, developed my town a lot, and had fun without being aware of my knee. So thanks game developers, you're more effective than the opiods I was prescribed for pain.",
  "Great game and no ads!!! A great time waster. Play at your own speed. If you're patient, things advance nicely. You don't need to spend actual money to advance in the game; it just takes longer. Side puzzles are fun as well.",
  "I enjoy not having to wait for energy to build up to move around and play in my town. most games you start with energy that you quickly burn through and then you wait all day for your energy to build back up! this game I don't bother with that!!",
  "Township is truly an amazing game...it is interactive and never a dull moment. I play it daily just to break up my day a little. No ads or interruptions just fun and enjoyment all around. My family all play and they love it too. Awesome game for any age. I say download and try it today and see for yourself. You can Township too.",
  "All around great game. If you love farming and building towns this game is for you. Great graphics and not laggy. Barely any adds. There are opportunities to communicate with friends and help them out, and much more.",
  "Still my go to game, still fun, every update is something new and exciting, always celebrating holidays which makes this game more fun. I also met a lot of ppl from different parts of the world who also have Townships of their own. Plus, there's always side games to add more adventure to Township without downloading a game like it. Great game",
  "Great game with good design and cute graphics. Spending is an option, but not required so far. No ads. Very entertaining.",
  "I simply love this game. I love the town I built. I love the story that each neighborhood is telling. I love the challenges and find myself engrossed that it's the next day, and I've been up all night. My mind is always being changed!",
  "As an 'orginal farm game' player fanatic including many years later the mobile app, this game is amazing. You can actually play the game without being bothered with ads and being asked constantly to spend 'real' money.",
  "Fun to play. Easy to understand and a nice level of challenge and engagement without significant pay wall. Good animations!",
  "One of the better games on the Tapjoy offer wall. It doesn't have an ad any time you do anything, and it doesn't require you to be on it 24/7. Simple design and very engaging.",
  "Can't stop playing! The farm animals get fed relatively quickly, and the train is amazing at getting you the otherwise hard to get build materials.",
  "So I've been playing this game for a few months now. I'm a regular, so I really enjoy watching everything coming into full bloom, sending things off, and watching my town grow.",
  "This game is so wholesome and enjoyable! I usually play more fast-paced shooter games, but sometimes I feel the need to calm down and relax... this seems to do just that. With that being said, I'm a proud player of this game. Thnx to the developers for making such a chill and relaxing game :)",
  "It's a fun game, and you're not watching adds every 30 seconds. This is one of the few games you're not constantly having to watch ads",
  "It was the best game ever downloaded at first it is not so interesting but later when l leveled up found it so intersting and I feel no problem with it. I love this game. For me it deserve five star",
  "I wasn't even going to play this game but the relentless ads dragged me in. I was expecting to have to pay to truly play but so long as you are ok with grinding you can get enough of the premium currency without paying for which I like.",
  "Just downloaded it today but it seems like a really cute little game. The town is charming and i love the idea of building up a small town or community. I personally feel that this is a great thing to know, even if it does feel a bit childish but regardless the game is cute and entertaining",
  "It's good. We can design our own town. While waiting for the goods to be made, we can play match 3 with fun events. Also the game can be connected to facebook so we can play in multiple devices",
  "I love playing Township. The game is fast enough for me because of bad eyesight. Slow enough to plan out the town that works for me. If I could have another Township, I would in a New York minute. Lol",
  "Amazing I can plan my family and I like on every single level can unlock new things which makes it so much more fun to see new things",
  "The game is very intersting. I keep downloading it when i change phones. Peiple shouldn't complain about passing a level because that's where the fun is. I've had to play a level more than 10 times before getting it but persistence made me pass the stage and i felt joy knowing i finally did it. It's a game that exersises you mentally and i recommend it to everyone both young and old",
  "It's RARE that I play any sort of video game, and let's be honest, most are really a horrible waste of time! But this game appeared in my phone after a normal update. Just before I went to uninstall it, I decided to give it a chance and try it. I was surprised to discover that it was actually quite fun! Despite becoming totally engaged in it, I could also easily stop. It's a cute, satisfying little game for anybody who enjoys the theme of renovations.",
  "5 out of 5. The gameplay was nice and for some reason I really liked how the character waved and talked to me even if it is just NPCs, and I love to design it and collect coins. I enjoy the puzzle because it reminds me of candy crush, If you like designing and Pretty simple puzzles, this is the game for you :)",
  "the best experience in all platforms i support their content",
  "The app is slick, and works seamlessly. Finally LinkedIn has a native windows app!",
  "I dont typically review games. But if you want a game that you can get on and play for awhile straight or just get on for a few minutes this is great! I'm a hairstylist and i'm always sttuggling to find a simple game I can play during small breaks and long breaks but never have to switch my game. And this one is it. They give you so many power ups and I think almost every time I get on I have an hour of unlimited lives! Just dowload it! Oh and did I mention NO ANNOYING ADS!",
  "Very Fun! There's lots to do, an amazing storyline, and beautiful graphics. The only minor bad thing I can say about this game is that it can be kind of grindy sometimes... but that's just because I hadn't been taking the necessary steps before that point, so here's some tips. Upgrade your cookie houses early! Once you get to a high enough level, leveling up will require lots of xp, so it's best to start preparing for it before you get to that point.",
  "It's not a fancy game, but it's one of my go-to time-killers. Yes, there are ads after every level, but the levels take long enough that I don't mind. Some reviewers have said the ball movements are unpredictable, but I don't find that to be the case - it's sometimes hard to fine-tune where you want it to go, depending on the shape of the blocks (square or cut in half diagonally), where you hit a block, and whether there are additional items in the field (a little diamond-shaped thing makes the balls bounce unpredictably off its faceted top). I like these and plan strategy accordingly. There aren't any nauseatingly adorable little dragons or elves, no cutesy soundtrack, no side-games that I've seen - just a straightforward strategy puzzle.",
  "I really like this game. It kinda reminds me of one of the game variations of Super Breakout. It feels really satisfying to break the blocks with a long string of the bouncy balls.",
  "Even with the ads, it's not so bad. I like different ball options. The levels don't feel redundant either. Will continue to play since it's a good easy game.",
  "Great challenges and ideal to pass the time while waiting at appointments to be called in, etc. Good options to play the classic style and easy enough to achieve gems if you want the extra challenge.",
  "What's not to love? It's both an easy & increasingly challenging game. You can earn/buy things to help you win, there are different skins, & the games last approx 10-15 minutes. The ads are tolerable at 5-30 second long. I'm addicted to this game; it's my favorite toilet time activity!",
  "Fun way to pass the time when you're relaxing. Not that many ads.",
  "Downloaded this to get points on another one. I like this version of this type of game. I just installed it and I'm on level like 30 or something. Smooth & fast compared to other versions. There's a cursor at the bottom for more precise shoots. Graphics r nice, sounds are cool. No ads, so far, unless you watch for points/gems. I'd recommend this one.",
  "So satisfying! Love playing this on my OnePlus 11! For me this never gets old. I don't mind sitting on hold, waiting in line or boiling water when I have this installed.",
  "It is very nice to look at not many annoying adds that interrupt game play and it's very satisfying.",
  "Very good time waster with few ads.",
  "S/O to this lovely game app that has managed to survive several factory resets and changes of phone; still has all of my info. 500+ levels in and still plenty of play left in it.",
  "Liked it very much. Its a wonderful game. Put your minds off from the hard days work and any other stress. I give 5*. Tnx",
  "One of the best, great strategic brick brake game. I love this one! It is better than a lot of the others and new levels of extreme difficulty are introduced every month or two. This is my ideal time killer when out somewhere waiting for something. I've been loving what Mobirix is doing with their vast range of simple but progressively arduous game catalog of titles dating back to the 90's with a cutting edge twist.",
  "Love this game. I see people complaining about the ads, but I really haven't experienced this. I know an ad pops up each time you lose a level and have to restart, but if you're smart, you can avoid actually losing any level. I'm not going to divulge this trick since it would interfere with their ability to make money, but come on people. Even if you do have to watch an ad between attempts or levels, it's a free game with THOUSANDS of free levels. Calm down.",
  "Amazing! Not only is it fun, they do adds right!!! Most phone games nowadays have so many ads that there is a way more ad time than there is game time which makes most people uninstall after a while. There are ads, but it's just the occasional ones on the way top of your screen so you don't accidentally click one! And barely see them! Bravo!!!",
  "A delightful surprise! I downloaded this game to obtain points in another app, but imagine my surprise when I find this lovely game! It has one little ad at the top but aside from that, no ads!! You can actually play the game quite comfortably! it's basically 99% gameplay!! What a treat! It has lots of levels and it's rather fun! I'm definitely keeping this game downloaded!",
  "This is one of my favorite games. It's very simple, but it's also challenging and fun. I use it to clear my mind or pass the time.",
  "This game is seriously so much fun. The ads sty at the top and do not interfere with the game! There's also none of those annoying ads in between levels! Honestly, download it. You won't regret it. I really love that the colors change as you get the blocks hit. Great work y'all!",
  "It is a very awesome game, I'm enjoying every second of it and I love how these rewards keep coming in that's real dope.",
  "This is such an addictive game. I really like the new update which gives you more levels and you can earn many diamonds. I've been playing this game while watching movies, videos, even listening to lectures at my university. It's a perfect background game that helps you focus if you're like me and need multiple stimulations. It's also very satisfying. A big plus is definitely low amount of ads. I highly recommend it.",
  "Keeps the mind Sharp very good for pool table players (Angles) it's All about Angles and keeping count mathematics! Greatgame",
  "This game is FUN. I love the fact there are no ads unless you choose to get power ups.",
  "Best ever with WiFi ads gives u point's",
  "Fun game! Very dependent on ads/purchases, but overall a good experience. At least there exist ways to succeed without p2w, so that's good. I like how the challenge level increases the longer you play, and the game has all sorts of hidden opportunities that you can use to maximize your chances. I also like how they continue to improve in game events, like rebounds and keeper coming off his line.",
  "Good game, I really like it",
  "This game is magnificent, awesome. I have been playing for 3 yrs now and no issues. You can also make real friends from the association group",
  "Good game Good strategy good looking thank you all Nice game",
  "I am playing the game since the begining and i still enjoy it like on the first day!!",
  "8 months/seasons in and still hooked. Good balance, something to play a few times a day but doesnt take over! 10/10",
  "Great game indeed. The BEST managerial platform out there. No doubt.",
  "so far so good, I'm enjoying my experience. im level 4 and have 3 leagues,I'm now focusing on winning the champion league and cup for next season",
  "great game very interactive",
  "the best Manager games out there, if not the best. Keep it up guys. I love it...",
  "Great game, have to give it 5 stars.",
  "Good game for anyone who love challenges. Improved fairness in the competition",
  "If you commit yourself and play for at least 20 mins a day you'll get your rewards. Don't give up!!! Go For it!...",
  "Brilliant fun game, very competitive with global players, superb matchplay and graphics. Great team goals too",
  "Haven't played in a while",
  "I honestly think this is the best game of its type that I've tried. Unlike some of the other games of its kind, I still feel like I'm making progress and can earn gems (the game's premium currency) to unlock things, even if I don't play every day or that often when I do at times. The dragons are cute and have interesting designs, and there's plenty to collect! Ads are still a thing, of course, but being able to still progress without having to purchase things makes it more than managable!",
  "Great game!!!! The customer support is there for you when you need them, everything is proportionate to your level, so its just as difficult to get certain things at a level 10 as a level 50. I recommend this game to anyone that wants something cool and fun to play, without the worry of being attacked by everyone and losing progress. Noone trash talks, and everything is very stressless.",
  "This game is so cool that I never expected I was totally attracted to play this game which I never used so other days now I cannot delete this game this game is become one of my favourite games In this game I have many dragons collection but I still play this game in game new event we're epic and and other event are also epic I love this game Dragon mania legends is going crazy THANK YOU SO MUCH",
  "I love thist game and dragons . The dragons loocks so pretty and specially LMT dragons are so beautiful . I LOVE this game because of weekly and monthly new events . The game is so attractive.",
  "Oh my god this game is amazing i previously played a game called dragon city and i liked the concept so much but the loading screen and ads not to mention their pay to win feature made it miserable this game eliminated all that problems and its gameplay is just second to none . KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK",
  "Because this game is very nice. And it's hane good graffic as compared to Dragon city.",
  "Used to play this back when I was a kid, came back half a decade later. Still the best breeding game out there",
  "Really fun! I love the attention to detail in every aspect of this game. Devs are responsive to feedback. I'm progressing nicely - not too fast or slow - sometimes grindy, but that's expected. Got to level 25 & still fun. There's lots that keeps this fresh. I don't feel the ads/$ is burdensome. Made some purchases when I want to rush things, but it's not necessary to pay to progress. Really enjoying this world, thank you! To new players, def recommend checking out the Discord sooner vs later.",
  "I rarely write reviews, so this one is personal. Other people have strongly suggested the game, and I'll add my voice to the choir -- what a well made, non-ad intrusive game. The game has animal crossing style graphics, with an addicting gameplay system that keeps me coming back each day. Best of all, the ads aren't intrusive, and the rewards for money spent is worth it. I've been more willing to spend money on this game because I want to support the good practices made by the company. BRAVO!",
  "Very fun, gamr has the perfect balance between idle and active gameplay. You can choose to play to collect your rewards and do a mission or two, or you can grind out missions and contracts for hours at a time. game is surprisingly difficult and strategic, with loads of bots abilities and gadgets to keep the game entertaining and fresh. There are always things to be working toward, as well as a fun online arena which is also completely optional. the game is great, with many ways to play and enjoy",
  "I haven't gotten hooked on a mobile game for a couple years it feels like. Not sure why but Botworld has definitely changed that. I can't stop! It has just enough loot grinding to make me want to keep playing but not so much that it's tedious. There's a ton of strategy in how you use your bots so it'll keep you trying to improve. And There's an auto battle mode so you can still progress in this time when you can't really focus 100%, like when you should be working ;)",
  "Really awesome game! It's a wonder it's free! I put some money in it but only because I wanted to support the developers, it's totally free to play though and you can be great at the game playing that way too. You find blueprints around an open world and build robots (from scrap you find around said open world) and battle NPCs and other real players. There's a story and daily quests and somewhat of a battle pass like system as well. Super fun game! Definitely give it a try.",
  "Great game, I've been playing non-stop since getting it. I spent money to get the pass, but it doesn't seem like you need to spend anything to progress. If you're like me (fulltime job, family responsibilities, etc.) the ad removal for $6 is totally worth saving time. Combat is automatic, you only control your powers and where you place your bots. But this still offers plenty of strategy. They only give you 500 characters for these reviews, so I'll just say I highly recommend getting this game",
  "This is a great moble game! The battle system is fun and unique, the graphics are great, and paying and watching adds just speeds things up a bit... there is nothing you can get through paying that you cant get through normal gameplay which is a nice change of pace. Getting new bots is pretty fun too. You scavenge scrap from the world or beat NPCs in battles to build new bots with certain scraps dropping more frequently depending on how the battle was fought. I love this game, it's worth a try",
  "This game has been an excellent adventure while I'm quarantined at home with Covid. Highly addicting and endlessly fun, I have yet to find a feature of the game that I don't enjoy. The cherry on top is that there is no pay-to-win; everything is attainable through regular gameplay and minimal grinding, plus there are no ads unless you choose to watch them for rewards. The battles are engaging, the environment tantalizing, and the bots charming. An excellent take on the monster collecting genre.",
  "So far Botworld has been an enjoyable experience, with it's interesting take on both adventure and the world as a whole. You are a newbie getting ready to set out to become a botmaster! A user of various types of bots with different roles in arena styled battles. The roles being ranged, tank or close ranged combantants with their own style of combat. I just set out on the adventure, but interested to see how it plays out. Worth a play!",
  "An absolute gem of a game! Gameplay is fun, doesn't drag on, the mechanics are easy to understand but not to simple to be boring, and everything is just so cute! The ads are all optional but best believe I'll be watching them to help support the game! There aren't a lot of bots, but that makes each of them special and recognizable! I'd definitely recommend this game!",
  "It's a pretty great little game. It has premium currency, but it's definitely not needed for the full experience! I made a purchase just to show my appreciation to the developers for making a genuinely solid little game! Hopefully we can get some more bots and a little more customization in the future. I'll definitely stick around to see.",
  "It takes a very, very good game for me to take the effort of writing a review. This is one of those games. The amount of time that has gone into this game blows my mind considering it is free. The ads are not pushy whatsoever and completely your choice on whether you watch them or not. The story is fun, upgrading bots is rewarding and doesn't feel grindy, the NPC's are funny and memorable, the daily missions so far have not felt repetitive. There's few cons I would mention but I'm at word limit.",
  "Tons of content! The whole game is free to play, but there is a season pass system that requires buy-in for extra rewards. Nevertheless, there are still plenty of choices for team building, even for free players. There are a multitude of energy systems here, but there is always something to do. Combat is deep but not too complicated. Plus, very cute animals.",
  "I'm not really a fan of pokemon style, catch and collect games, but this one is surprisingly addictive. Good graphics, simple controls, easy to understand UI, and simple game play make this game addictive and great fun to play",
